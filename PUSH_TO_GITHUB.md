# Quick GitHub Push Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `fin-report-agent`
3. **IMPORTANT**: Leave all checkboxes UNCHECKED (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Copy the Commands GitHub Shows You

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. They'll look like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fin-report-agent.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Run Those Commands

Open your terminal in the `fin-report-agent` folder and paste those commands.

**OR** if you want me to do it, just paste the repository URL here (e.g., `https://github.com/username/fin-report-agent.git`) and I'll run the commands for you!
